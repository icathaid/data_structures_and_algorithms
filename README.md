##  Code Challenge 08 - Linked List Merge

Lab Partner Edward Mark Puzino

Note:  I didn't realize until I got home that the picture is completely unreadable, i'll redo this one myself later.


##  Challenge

  Write a function `mergeLists` which takes two linked lists as arguments.  Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the (new) zipped list.  

  Try to keep additional space down to O(1).

  You have access to the Node class and all Linked List properties and methods created in previous challenges.
